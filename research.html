                     <p> This study examines spatially dynamic diffusion processes of local policy adoption among municipal governments. Using city-level climate action plans (CAPs) adopted in the Southern California region during 2000-2018 as a study frame, our analysis unpacks spatial variations in the effects of geographic neighbors and regional leaders on local policy diffusion processes. We first argue that both factors will spur CAP diffusion among city governments. We then develop a novel hypothesis of a spatial moderating effect between these two influences. Specifically, we theorize that adjacent neighboring diffusion effects will be less prominent in the areas with nearby regional innovators, while neighboring effects will be more prominent in the absence of regional policy leadership. To examine this, we first use traditional event history and logistic regression analyses. We then investigate inter-city diffusion dynamics in greater detail with a novel geographically weighted regression (GWR) method that unravels regional variations in local diffusion effects. Our aggregate analysis finds that both geographic neighbors and regional leaders drive the diffusion of local CAP adoptions. The novel application of GWR further shows marked spatial variations within the region, suggesting that neighboring proximity-driven diffusion effects are muted by the influence of regional leaders. By spatially unpacking the effect of geographic proximity and regional leadership in policy diffusion, this study enhances our understanding of dynamic and varied diffusion processes.</p>

                     <p> Why do political leaders travel abroad? In this article, we propose an informational mechanism linking in-person diplomacy to leader survival. A foreign power visits an incumbent in order to reap a future policy concession; the visit is only worth the effort if the incumbent remains in power long enough to deliver on the deal. A diplomatic visit thus provides a visible and credible signal of the visitor's high confidence in the incumbent's stability in office. Domestic opponents, facing incomplete information as to the incumbent's strength, observe the signal and are deterred from mounting a challenge. Using data on U.S. diplomatic visits from 1960 to 2013, we find strong empirical support for our predictions: A visit with the U.S. president substantially reduces the risk of a leader's removal from office.</p>

                     <p> Diplomacy always occurs in the shadow of domestic political competition. We develop a model of top-level diplomatic exchange embedded within a global game of regime change, and examine four mechanisms that induce a relationship between diplomatic visits and regime survival. First, the foreign leader chooses to visit incumbents who are ex ante more secure in office (a selection effect). Second, because the foreign leader’s decision is based partly on private information, the citizens update on the revelation of that information (a learning effect) and are discouraged from mounting a challenge. Third, the foreign leader can bolster the incumbent’s strength in office with a transfer of material support (a strengthening effect). The latter two effects are then amplified by the complementarities in the citizens’ strategies (a multiplier effect). Contrary to standard global games results, we show that increased precision in the public information transmitted strategically by the foreign power induces a unique equilibrium, as citizens coordinate on the foreign leader’s action. Our findings explain why leaders are so eager to receive state visits from major world powers.</p>

                  <!-- # Book Projects The Bureaucratic Origins of Conflict and Cooperation (Draft chapters available on request)<br/> <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p> Does diplomacy affect the prospects of international conflict and cooperation? This book argues that if we wish to understand whether and why diplomacy matters, we need to look not only to the relationship between states, but also to the relationship between the individual who conducts diplomacy and the government on whose behalf she conducts it. I develop a theory of delegated diplomacy, centering on the interests and influence of individual actors within government. Relative to other participants in the policy process, ambassadors hold the strongest interest in cooperative relations with their host governments. They generally wield substantial influence over policies enacted towards their host governments, but their influence is intermittently weakened by routine ambassadorial turnovers. When diplomatic influence in the policy process is undermined, bilateral problems go unresolved, and opportunities for bilateral cooperation are foregone. I test the theory in the context of post-World War II US ambassadorial appointments, leveraging the State Department’s routinized three-year rotation schedule as a natural experiment to isolate as-if-random variation in ambassadorial vacancy. I find that the removal of a US ambassador leads to an increased risk of militarized dispute with the country experiencing the turnover, and a decreased volume of economic exchange with that country. Further examination of the mechanisms indicates that interim officials (who serve during vacancies) enjoy less access to top-level decision makers than do presidentially-appointed ambassadors; that they play a less active role in internal policy advocacy; and that they are less effective in getting their host country’s concerns onto the US foreign policy agenda.</p></details> &nbsp; A Political Economy of Public Diplomacy (with Alastair Smith) (in progress) -->

                     <p> How do leaders select their top-level foreign policy appointees? Existing explanations point to appointees' hands-tying value at the international bargaining table, or their ability to insulate leaders from domestic political criticism. This paper evaluates these explanations through a formal model of the domestic and intragovernmental politics surrounding an international crisis. In the model, a leader selects a foreign policy appointee, anticipating how the appointee will shape the advice he receives in the crisis, the electoral incentives he faces, and ultimately the policies that he and his foreign counterparts pursue as a consequence. The analysis uncovers a fundamental strategic tension in the leader's ability use appointments to advance his core political and policy objectives---deterring foreign aggression, obtaining valuable policy advice, and maximizing domestic approval: any appointment that advances one of these objectives invariably comes at the cost of another, and the leader's appointment strategy must balance across these tradeoffs. Analyzing cross-national appointment patterns to the offices of ministers of defense and foreign affairs, we find descriptive evidence consistent with the model's predictions: leaders from dovish parties are more likely than leaders from hawkish parties to select cross-partisan and politically independent appointees, and such appointments are less likely for leaders of either party as they approach reelection.</p>

                     <p> What makes some bureaucrats more influential than others in shaping U.S. foreign policy?I argue that a bureaucrat's appointment status---whether or not she has received a presidential appointment and senate confirmation---serves as a coordination device to guide the behavior of other actors across the U.S. government and beyond toward that bureaucrat, ultimately determining the degree of influence she is able to exercise in the foreign policy process. I test the theory in the context of U.S. ambassadorial appointments, leveraging the State Department's routinized rotation schedule as a natural experiment to isolate exogenous variation in ambassadorial vacancy. Compared to presidential appointees, I find that acting officials play a less active role in internal advocacy over policy, as measured by diplomatic cable traffic; that they receive less access to top-level decision makers, as documented in presidential meeting schedules; and that they are less effective in getting their host countries' concerns onto the US foreign policy agenda, as indicated by written presidential orders, international agreements, and presidential diplomatic travel. The findings demonstrate that bureaucrat-level variation can create significant distortions in the allocation of time, effort, and attention across foreign policy issues.</p>

                     <p> Can executive appointees affect foreign policy? Through a formal model of international crisis bargaining and electoral competition, we investigate the international consequences of foreign policy appointments, recognizing that appointees lack independent authority over policy and can be removed or overridden at the whim of the leader. The model elucidates two mechanisms through which appointees can influence a state’s foreign policy behavior: by shaping the leader’s informational environment through private advice, and by altering the leader’s electoral incentives through the threat public dissent. We demonstrate that appointments can enhance deterrence against foreign aggression. However, this deterrent benefit necessarily comes at the expense of other aspects of citizen welfare: a deterrence-enhancing appointment must either weaken policy responsiveness, or undermine electoral selection, or both, and the relative severity of these tradeoffs varies with the political party of the leader. The results help to explain why Democratic U.S. Presidents regularly appoint conservatives and independents to key foreign policy posts within their administrations, while Republicans consistently appoint co-partisans.</p>

                     <p> Powerful states exert influence over international organizations (IOs) in a manner that is at odds with the organizational mission and the interests of the broader membership. Yet other member states actively participate in these organizations despite this hegemonic influence. Under what conditions can such a system be sustained, and what are the implications for IO performance? To answer these questions, this paper examines the relationship between vote shares, cost shares, and agency expertise in a model of project finance within an IO. We develop a game-theoretic model of the strategic interaction between a membership who wants the IO to provide a global public good, a hegemon who wants to advance its private interests through the IO, and a secretariat who is accountable to both principals. In equilibrium, the secretariat biases its recommendations in favor of the hegemon’s interests, even though their primitive preferences diverge. The members tolerate this influence to a limited degree, in exchange for the benefits they enjoy from the hegemon’s financial contributions, and the project expertise that the IO provides. Increased IO expertise limits the degree to which the secretariat “shades” its recommendations, and reduces the value of larger vote shares for the hegemon. We show that IO expertise is bounded in equilibrium: participation is incentive-compatible for all members only if the secretariat is not “too good” at its job. Our model provides a unified theoretical framework to explain conditions of IO design, accession, exit, and reform.</p>

(*Job market paper*.)<br /> <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p> International economic competition has led to the increasing adoption of labor-replacing technology. What are the consequences of this development for the political influence of organized labor? I posit that robots make (skilled) workers more productive, increasing the opportunity cost of rent-seeking behavior via union activities. Consequently, the political influence of organized labor falls in response to robot adoption because unionization declines. I provide evidence for my claims using data from the U.S. (2004-2014) and a shift-share that leverages quasi-exogenous variation in international competition in the exposure to robots, at the congressional district level. An increase in one robot per a thousand workers reduces the likelihood that congresspeople vote with unions' interests by two percentage points. This effect is larger in areas with higher portions of skilled workers, lending support to the hypothesized opportunity-cost mechanism. Reductions in unionization, union activities and in campaign contributions in response to the exposure to robots explain this finding. Using demediation analysis I demonstrate that my findings are driven especially by lower unionization rates and not by the potentially competing effect of robots on unemployment.</p></details> &nbsp; [Manuscript](/files/pdf/research/Unions_and_robots.pdf){: .btn--research} **Elite cues, identity and protectionism.** Mimeo, New York University. 2022. <br /> <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p> The combination of populism and protectionism emerged primarily from social class cleavages during the 20th century, to protect those affected by international economic competition. In the 21st century these cleavages have also involved an ethnic dimension, which regards the ethnic majority as the citizens deserving protection even though ethnic minorities are affected by international competition. What does explain this puzzle? I posit that this protectionist populism is especially likely to emerge when populists shape voters’ preferences over protectionism using elite cues. Cues generate voter polarization by activating voters’ social identities, and this benefits populists. Populists may not use cues on ethnic minorities when their support isn't essential because doing so isn't cost-effective. Counterintuitively, populists use cues when there’s little voter polarization ex-ante. I also find that higher international competition is generally insufficient to generate demands for protectionist populism in the absence of elite cues. My findings also provide various empirical implications.</p></details> &nbsp; [Manuscript](/files/pdf/research/Top_down_identity_politics.pdf){: .btn--research} **Tariff revenues matter for democratization: Theory and evidence from the First Wave of Globalization.** Mimeo, New York University. 2022. <br /> *with [Rafael Ch](https://wp.nyu.edu/rafaelch/).* <br /> <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Do tariff revenues affect democratization? We argue that tariff revenues have two effects: i) A rapacity effect because the fiscal windfalls generate incentives to control government, and ii) A redistributive effect because tariffs impact the returns to the factors of production, changing the distribution of power between politically-relevant groups. If ruling elites benefit from redistribution, this discourages a challenge to their rule. If elites lose from redistribution, they may share power to avoid expropriation. We test these claims during the First Wave of Globalization, when ruling elites were often landed. We find causal evidence that tariff revenues reduce democratization in land-abundant economies because ruling elites strengthen via the redistributive effect, as the return to land increases, and the windfalls bolster the rapacity effect. In capital-abundant economies the return to land falls, thus the redistributive effect offsets the rapacity effect. Congruently, we find a positive but statistically-insignificant effect for tariff revenues.</p></details> &nbsp; [Manuscript](/files/pdf/research/Trade_and_autocracy.pdf){: .btn--research} **Climate change and political (in)stability.** Mimeo, New York University. 2022. *R&R at American Political Science Review.* <br /> *with [Amanda Kennard](https://sites.google.com/site/akennard240/).* <br /> <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>As climate change accelerates, a looming question is what effects warming will have on the stability and organization of political systems.

We provide causal evidence for our claims using panel data at the household level for India (2005-2012). We find an increase in temperature of 3◦ Celsius reduces trust in political leaders and domestic security forces by around 2 percentage points (PP) while increasing cooperation by 3PP. We document further causal evidence for the underlying mechanisms by examining the impacts of climate on agricultural incomes, rates of violent and non-violent crime, and intra-community conflict.

Can economic interdependence address these problems? I develop a theoretical model where unity within states exhibits a U-shape as a function of interdependence within country. High levels of interdependence promote unity because they generate efficiency costs that tie the hands of the governments towards improving the spatial distribution of resources, increasing the opportunity cost of a dislocation. For low levels of interdependence, unity is achieved through the threat of coercion. At intermediate levels, neither redistribution nor coercion are sufficient for deterrence, thus the probability for secessionist conflict rises. I also show that stronger economic ties to other countries hamstring unity when the latter provide substitutes to local goods. If the home country economy becomes less competitive, governments' efficiency costs decrease and thus redistribution, reducing the likelihood of unity. This study provides new perspectives for studying trade, conflict and state formation.</p></details> &nbsp; [Available upon request](mailto:cfbalcazar@nyu.edu){: .btn--research}<hr /><hr /> # Publications **The Value of Redistribution: Natural Resources and the Formation of Human Capital under Weak Institutions.** *Journal of Development Economics*, Vol. 149, 102581. 2021. <br /> *with [Jorge Aguero](https://aguero.econ.uconn.edu/), [Stanislao Maldonado](https://www.stanislaomaldonado.org/) and [Hugo Ñopo](https://www.grade.org.pe/en/investigadores/personal/hnopo/).* <br /> <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We exploit time and spatial variation generated by the commodities boom to measure the effect of natural resources on human capital formation in Peru, a country with low governance indicators.

However, and consistent with recent political economy models, the relationship is non-monotonic. Based on these models, we identify improvements in school expenditure and infrastructure, together with increases in health outcomes of adults and children, as key mechanisms explaining the effect we find for redistribution.

However, assigning a value to the flow of services from dwellings is problematic. Many households own the dwelling in which they live, making this value unobserved; others receive free housing or face prices lower than those at the market. Over the last decades, several estimation techniques have been proposed and implemented by practitioners to overcome this issue. This paper provides a review of methods commonly used to impute rent and discusses the relative advantages and disadvantages of each. We find no consensus on which imputation method is the most appropriate for welfare analysis, as well as a lack of evidence regarding the distributional impact of including rents in the welfare aggregate, particularly in developing countries. Moreover, practices for imputing rents vary across countries, calling for the future development of a unified framework.</p></details> &nbsp; [Article](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/roiw.12312/full){: .btn--research} [Preprint](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ds28od8hj5uzld8/Rent-Imputation%20for%20Welfare%20Measurement.pdf?dl=0){: .btn--research} **Long-Run Effects of Democracy on Income Inequality in Latin America.** *Journal of Economic Inequality*, Vol. 14, No. 3, pp. 289-307.2016.<br /> <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>I address the link between democracy and inequality in Latin America, analyzing whether the degree of democracy that birth cohorts experience during the course of their formative years is related to labor income dispersion later, in adulthood. For this, I measure inequality at the cohort level by using pseudo-panel data built from household surveys for fifteen Latin American countries (from circa 1995 to circa 2011) and measure democracy as the discounted cumulative value of the degree of democracy during the cohort’s formative years. I find that cohorts that have higher discounted cumulative values of the degree of democracy show lower income inequality. However, the effect of democracy on income dispersion is driven by those cohorts that benefited from the surge of democracies that came to exist during the second half of the twentieth century. I also present suggestive evidence that education is one mechanism explaining these results.</p></details> &nbsp; [Article](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10888-016-9329-3?wt_mc=internal.event.1.SEM.ArticleAuthorOnlineFirst){: .btn--research} [Preprint](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tkcestaztkoesc7/Long_run_effects_democracy_on_inequality.pdf?dl=0){: .btn--research} [Replication Archive](https://www.dropbox.com/s/14qx30huy7ydfc3/Replication%20files.rar?dl=0){: .btn--research} [Online appendix](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wlgwbxd82t7jixs/Online%20appendix.pdf?dl=0){: .btn--research} **Broken gears: the value added of higher education on teachers’ academic achievement.** Higher Education, Vol. 72, No. 3, pp. 341-361. 2016. <br /> *with [Hugo Ñopo](https://www.grade.org.pe/en/investigadores/personal/hnopo/).*<br /> <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Good teachers are essential for high-quality educational systems. However, little is known about teachers’ skill formation during college. By combining two standardized tests for Colombian students, one taken at the end of senior year in high school and the other when students are near graduation from college, we test the extent to which students majoring in education relatively improve or deteriorate their skills in quantitative reasoning, native language and foreign language, in comparison with students in other programs. We find that teachers’ skills vis-à-vis those in other majors deteriorate in quantitative reasoning and foreign language, although these skills deteriorate less for those in math-oriented and foreign language-oriented programs, respectively. For native language, we do not find evidence of robust differences in relative learning mobility.</p></details> &nbsp; [Article](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10734-015-9960-0?wt_mc=internal.event.1.SEM.ArticleAuthorOnlineFirst){: .btn--research} [Preprint](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qa2hob38nmhrj9g/Broken%20gears%20-%20Manuscript.pdf?dl=0){: .btn--research} [Replication Archive](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hkp8gr51c1dq2ur/Replication%20files.rar?dl=0){: .btn--research} **Lower Bounds on Inequality of Opportunity and Measurement Error.** *Economics Letters*, Vol. 137, pp. 102-105. 2015. <br /> <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>I show that lower bound estimates of inequality of opportunity can have substantial measurement error, and that measurement error can vary considerably across samples.

The analysis employs a nonparametric decomposition method that measures the relative contributions of different components of household livelihoods to observed changes in poverty. The results show that poverty decline is associated with a significant increase in labor earnings, explained in turn by a steep rise in wages for unskilled labor, and diversification from farm to nonfarm sources of income in rural areas. Transfers, in the form of remittances and social programs, have contributed but are not the primary drivers of poverty decline over this period. The pattern of changes is consistent with processes associated with structural transformation, which add up to a highly pro-poor pattern of income growth over the initial distribution of income and consumption. However, certain social groups (Adivasis and Dalits) are found to be more likely to stay in or fall into poverty and less likely to move out of poverty. And even as poverty has reduced dramatically, the share of vulnerable population has not.</p></details> &nbsp; [Preprint](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2016/03/26073166/poverty-decline-india-nonparametric-decomposition-exercise){: .btn--research}<hr /><hr /> # Policy work Welfare dynamics in Colombia: results from synthetic panels.

The paper reports results from two approaches to define a vulnerability line: the first one employs a nonparametric and parsimonious model, while the second utilizes a fully parametric regression model with covariates. The estimation results suggest a range of between \$8 to \$13 per day per person in 2005 purchasing power parity dollars as the vulnerability line. Using an average daily vulnerability line of $10 per day per person, subsequent estimates on welfare dynamics suggest that, during the past decade, 20 percent of the Colombian population experienced downward mobility, and 24 percent experienced upward mobility. Furthermore, upward mobility increases with higher education levels and is lower for female-headed households.</p></details> &nbsp; [Policy paper](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/212121526317738485/pdf/WPS8441.pdf){: .btn--research} Heterogeneity and Household Life Cycle in the Multidimensional Poverty Index.

In this paper we propose a latent utility model to measure housing adequacy that is consistent with the guidelines in the United Nation’s Right to Adequate Housing. First, we provide formal proof that if discrete ordinal data on housing indicators meets the ordering consistency conditions defined herein, housing-adequacy rankings can be gleaned from the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue in Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA). Second, we define welfare consistent cut-off points for housing deprivation. The algorithm measures the incidence of housing deprivation as headcounts, providing a multidimensional poverty rate for housing.

Policy Research Working Paper Series 7824, The World Bank. 2016. *Background working paper for Nepal’s Poverty Assessment.* <br /> *with [Sailesh Tiwari](https://blogs.worldbank.org/team/sailesh-tiwari) and Akhmad Shidiq* <br /> <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This paper introduces a variety of concepts and methods to examine living standards improvements in Nepal in a dynamic perspective. Using data from three rounds of Nepal Living Standards Surveys conducted in the past two decades, together with data from a nationally representative survey that was implemented in 2014 specifically to collect information on social and economic mobility, the paper presents novel statistics on the extent of inter- and intra-generational mobility in Nepal. The findings suggest that there has been appreciable upward mobility in education; that is, Nepalis today are increasingly more likely to be better educated than their parents. However, inter-generational mobility of occupations has been much more muted, with 47 percent of Nepal today remaining in the same occupation as their parents. Upward mobility is higher for younger cohorts and for individuals who move from their rural areas of birth to an urban area. There are also significant differences in mobility by social groups, with Dalits and Terai caste groups having lower upward mobility odds. Examining mobility within generations using synthetic panel techniques, the paper finds that: (a) for every two people who escape poverty, one slides back, suggesting significant churning around the poverty line; (b) a large fraction of those who have escaped poverty remain vulnerable to falling back, with an overall vulnerable population of 45 percent; and (c) the share of the middle class—defined as those with sufficiently low likelihood of falling back into poverty—has increased steadily over the past two decades, reaching 22 percent in 2010–11. However, triangulating subjective well-being data from Gallup, it appears that a majority of even those who constitute the middle class are fundamentally insecure about their economic futures. The prevalence of a large vulnerable population and a nascent, growing but struggling middle class represents a key challenge to consolidating recent gains in moving people out of poverty.</p></details> &nbsp; [Policy paper](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/774971473947670354/Mobility-and-pathways-to-the-middle-class-in-Nepal){: .btn--research} Born with a silver spoon: inequality in educational achievement across the world.

Differences in wealth, parental education, and area of residence explain a bulk of this inequality in most of the countries in the sample. Consistent with what has been documented previously in the literature, the paper also finds a strong and stable correlation between inequality of opportunity and public spending on school education. An exploration of the changes in inequality of opportunity between the 2009 and 2012 rounds of the Programme for International Student Assessment, using parametric and nonparametric techniques, suggests that there has been little progress.</p></details> &nbsp; [Policy paper](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/750071468142789957/Born-with-a-silver-spoon-inequality-in-educational-achievement-across-the-world){: .btn--research} -->
